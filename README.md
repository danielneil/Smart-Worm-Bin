# Smart-Worm-Habitat

An [open source](https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/doc/what-does-opensource-mean.MD) design for a modular worm habitat that efficiently converts food waste into vermicast, and monitors the health of itself using a little computer (nawww).

## What is a Smart Worm Habitat? 

The Smart Worm Habitat (SWH) is a [continuous flow through (CFT)](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/) vermicompost system that converts foodwaste into the best fertiliser known to mankind, vermicast! 

CFT systems vastly improves the efficiency of harvesting vermicast, as they allow the worms to remain undisturbed in the layers above, while the vermicast is collected (harvested) from below.   

Also, the SWH uses a computer to monitor the health of itself using several sensors, namely moisture, PH level and temperature.

It might end up looking like this..

## How is it "smart"? 

Well, you know how your smart phone is "smart" because it has a computer inside it, same dealio with the SWH - it uses a computer to monitor the following: 

* Outside Temperature
* Inside Temperature 
* Soil Moisture level
* Soil PH level 

& with pretty graphs!

## Emissions Reduction 

The primary purpose of the SWH is to be able to efficiently covert captured food waste into vermicast, and reduce the associated greenhouse gases should that food waste had of ended up in landfill.

The SWH will stop **3,249kg** of CO2-e entering the atmosphere (equivalent to 11.24 petrol tanks), every single month, and that's just one unit - imagine if we had lots of them!

The software will also provide a data entry tool to record the weights of input to calculate total emission savings.

## It sends alerts, too!

The SWH will monitor and send alerts whenever it suspects the worms are in trouble! 

The alerts will be a pretty WebUI coupled with email notification. 

## And...it can watch them ;)

An infrared camera will takes a happy snap every 30 minutes, with its primary purpose to monitor worm feeding and migration patterns.

P.s. they always go for the watermelon first.
