# Smart-Worm-Bin

A smart worm bin system that monitors the health of a worm bin using a little computer (nawww).

## What does it monitor? 

* Outdoor Temp
* Soil Temperature 
* Soil Moisture level
* Soil PH level 

& with pretty graphs too!

## It sends alerts, too 

It will email you if any of monitored items go above or below declared thresholds. 

## And it can watch them ;)

The infrared camera will takes a happy snap every 30 minutes. 

Ps.s they always go for the water melon first. 

## Help me code!
