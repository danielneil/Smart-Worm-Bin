# Smart-Worm-Habitat

An open [source design](https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/doc/what-does-opensource-mean.MD) for a modular worm habitat that efficiently converts food waste into vermicast, and monitors the health of itself using a little computer (nawww).

## What is a Smart Worm Habitat? 

The Smart Worm Habitat is a [continuous flow](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/) worm farm system that converts foodwaste into the best fertiliser known to mankind, vermicast! The continuous flow system vastly improves the efficiency of the harvesting process, and allows the worms to remain undisturbed in the layers above.   

It uses a computer to monitor the health of the habitat using several sensors, namely moisture, PH level and temperature.

It might end up looking like this..

## How is it "smart"? 

Well, you know how your smart phone is "smart" because it has a computer inside it, same dealio with the Smart Worm Habitat - it uses a computer to monitor the following: 

* Outside Temperature
* Inside Temperature 
* Soil Moisture level
* Soil PH level 

& with pretty graphs!

## Emissions Reduction 

The primary purpose of the habitat is to be able to efficiently covert captured food waste into vermicast, and reduce the associated greenhouse gases should that food waste had of ended up in landfill.

The habitat will stop **5,198.40kg** of CO2-e entering the atmosphere (equivalent to 11.24 petrol tanks), every single month, and that's just one unit - imagine if we had lots of them!

The software will also provide a data entry tool to record the weights of input to calculate total emission savings.

## It sends alerts, too!

The system will monitor specific items and alert workers whenever they go above or below the declared thresholds.

The alerts will be a pretty WebUI  coupled with email notification. 

## And it can watch them ;)

An infrared camera will takes a happy snap every 30 minutes, with its primary purpose to monitor worm feeding and migration patterns.

P.s. they always go for the watermelon first.
