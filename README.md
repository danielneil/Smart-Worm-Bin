# Smart-Worm-Habitat

In the interest of combating climate change, an [open source](https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/doc/what-does-opensource-mean.MD) research project to develop a design for a vermicomposting system that efficiently converts food waste into vermicast, that is able to monitor the health of itself using software.

## What is a Smart Worm Habitat? 

The Smart Worm Habitat is a [continuous flow through (CFT)](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/) vermicompost system that converts foodwaste into the best fertiliser known to mankind, vermicast.

CFT systems vastly improves the efficiency of harvesting vermicast, as they allow the worms to remain undisturbed in the layers above, while the vermicast is collected (harvested) from below.   

Also, the Smart Worm Habitat uses a computer to monitor the health of itself using several sensors, namely moisture, PH level and temperature.

## How is it "smart"? 

Well, you know how your smart phone is "smart" because it has a computer inside it? the Smart Worm Habitat does too - it uses computer sensors to monitor the following: 

* Outside Temperature
* Inside Temperature 
* Soil Moisture level
* Soil PH level 

With all generated data sent to the cloud.

## Emissions Reduction 

The primary purpose of the Smart Worm Habitat is to be able to efficiently covert captured food waste into vermicast, and reduce the associated greenhouse gases should that food waste had of ended up in landfill.

The SWH will stop **1,368kg** of CO2-e entering the atmosphere (equivalent to 5.62 petrol tanks), every single month, and that's just one unit - imagine if we had lots of them!

The software will also provide a data entry tool to record the weights of input to calculate total emission savings.

## It sends alerts, too!

The Smart Worm Habitat will monitor and send alerts whenever it suspects the worms are in trouble! 

## And...it can watch them ;)

An infrared camera will takes a happy snap every 30 minutes, with its primary purpose to monitor worm feeding and migration patterns.

P.s. they always go for the watermelon first.
