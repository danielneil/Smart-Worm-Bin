## Request for Quotation

### To:	     <address>
### From:    <daniel> 
	
### Subject: Request for quotation for CAD draft for prototype of a Continuous Flow Through (CFT) Worm Bin.

Hello, 
	
I am writing to request a CAD draft for a prototype of a Continuous Flow Through (CFT) Worm Bin.
	
Please, find details as per below;

1.	The Requirement:

An open source CAD design for a Continuous Flow Through (CFT) Worm Bin.

2.	Overview of the Project

The Smart Worm Habitat is a continuous flow through (CFT) vermicompost system that converts foodwaste into vermicast.
CFT systems vastly improves the efficiency of harvesting vermicast, as they allow the worms to remain undisturbed in the layers above, while the vermicast is collected (harvested) from below.
	
The primary purpose of the project is to be able to efficiently covert captured food waste into vermicast, and reduce the associated greenhouse gases should that food waste had of ended up in landfill.

3.	Please find specifiations of the prototype at the web link:
	
https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/engineering/continuous-flow-worm-bin.MD
	
Further design suggestions or advice is welcome.
	
4.	Terms and Conditions
	
All correspondence will be in the public domain.
	
All drafts and designs will be in the public domain (opensource).

Regards,
Daniel Hodder
