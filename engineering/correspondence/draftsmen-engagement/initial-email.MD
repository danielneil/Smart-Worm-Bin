### Subject: Request for quotation for CAD draft for prototype of a Continuous Flow Through (CFT) Worm Bin.

Hello, 
	
I am writing to request your services to produce a CAD draft/design for a prototype of a Continuous Flow Through (CFT) Worm Bin.

Details are as per below:

## 1. Overview

The Smart Worm Habitat is a continuous flow through (CFT) vermicompost system that converts food waste into vermicast.

The primary purpose of the design is to be able to efficiently convert captured food waste into vermicast and reduce the associated greenhouse gases should that food waste have of ended up in landfill.

The project is aiming to use open-source initiatives of open exchange, collaborative participation, rapid prototyping, transparency, meritocracy, and community-oriented development in the interests of combating  climate change. 

## 2.	Prototype specification

Please find the engineering specification of the prototype upon which to base the CAD design/draft at the following Github link: 
	
https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/engineering/continuous-flow-worm-bin.MD
	
Further design suggestions or engineering advice is welcome.
	
## 3.	Terms and Conditions
	
All submitted CAD drafts/designs will be in the public domain (open source).
All invoices and receipts will be made available in the public domain.

Regards,
<probably-daniel>
