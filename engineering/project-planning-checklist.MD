# Battle Plan!

## GoFund Me Campaign (Stage 1) 

- [x] Create [GoFund me](https://www.gofundme.com/manage/smart-worm-farm) campaign
- [x] Publish to social media (facebook, reddit, etc)

## Engineering Design and Requirements Analysis (Stage 2) 

- [x] Continuous Flow Through (CFT) worm bin - [Detailed Design](https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Habitat/blob/main/engineering/continuous-flow-worm-bin.MD).
- [ ] Smart Worm Habitat (SWH) - Detailed Design.
- [ ] Little Computer (nawwww) - Detailed Design.
- [ ] Data Entry System - Detailed Design.
- [ ] Alerting System - Detailed Design.
- [ ] Sensors - Detailed Design.
- [ ] Habitat - CAD draft production.

## Smart Worm Habitat Construction (Stage 3)
 
 - [ ] Engage with three (3) draftsmen to obtain competitive quotes for CFT CAD design - publish correspondence to github for community visiability. 
 - [ ] Withdraw funds from GoFund me campaign to pay draftsmen for services, and offset the difference (if any) with personal contributions.
 - [ ] Engage with draftsman to digitally produce the CFT (based on the detailed design) using CAD. 
 - [ ] Engage with engineering firm/fabricator and submit CFT CAD drafts. 
 - [ ] Obtain quote for time and materials from engineering firm/fabricator.
 - [ ] Obtain timelime estimation of construction from engineering firm/fabricator.
 - [ ] Publish projected timeline for Smart Worm Habitat construction to GitHub.
 - [ ] Publish projected costs and other financials to Github for community visiability.
 - [ ] Organise delivery/collection of the Smart Worm Habitat upon completion. 
 - [ ] Installation of the Smart Worm Habitat prototype in testing facility (Daniel's Basement).  

## Computer and Sensor Hardware Procurement (Stage 4)

- [ ] Procure the appropriate Raspberry PI kit model. 
- [ ] Procure internal temp sensor.
- [ ] Procure external temp sensor.
- [ ] Procure pH sensor.
- [ ] Procure infred camera. 
- [ ] Procure appropriate computer->sensor connection mediums (usb cables).
- [ ] Publish reciepts and/or other financials to Github for community visiability.

## Software Development - Development Environment (Stage 5)

- [ ] Create an appropriate virtualised software development environment.
- [ ] Build raspberry standard raspberry pi image.
- [ ] Publish build artifacts to github.

## Software Development - Alert System (Stage 6)

- [ ] Download Nagios Core source code and install on the raspberry pi image.
- [ ] Downlaod Nagios Plugins source code and install on the raspberry pi image.
- [ ] Customised Nagios UI code to be suitable to the Smart Worm Habitat.
- [ ] Install RDMS on on the raspberry pi image.
- [ ] Write software for internal temp sensor as a Nagios Plugin
- [ ] Write software for external temp sensor as a Nagios Plugin.
- [ ] Write software for pH sensor as a Nagios Plugin
- [ ] Write software for infared camera as a Nagios Plugin. 

## Software Development - Data Entry System (Stage 7)

- [ ] Installation of DJANGO
- [ ] Write algos to calcuate input totals
- [ ] Write algos to calcuate emission reductions
- [ ] Write algos to calcuate input totals
- [ ] Write algos to calcuate worm reproductive totals
- [ ] Write algos to calcuate worm feeding patterns
- [ ] Write algos to calculate worm behavior using infrared data.
- [ ] Write prototype UI code to display the above items.

## Testing and Success Evaluation (Stage 8)

- [ ] Using prototype UI code, montor the system for a period of three months
- [ ] Publish associated metrics to Github for community visability.
