What is Continuous Flow Vermicomposting?

"Continuous flow is a method of vermicomposting where composting worms are fed organic matter from the top and worm castings are 
eventually harvested from the bottom or removed from a bottom tray. This bottom-to-top flow requires one of two things:

* a container or bin that allows for harvesting from the bottom to allow the worms working in the top layers of the bin to remain undisturbed.
* removable trays with perforated bottoms that allow for for upward migration, the assumption being that the top trays can be removed
periodically to allow for the removal of lower trays that are filled with finished vermicompost."
