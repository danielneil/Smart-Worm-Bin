## What is Continuous Flow Vermicomposting?

"Continuous flow is a method of vermicomposting where composting worms are fed organic matter from the top and worm castings are 
eventually harvested from the bottom or removed from a bottom tray. 

This bottom-to-top flow requires a container or bin that allows for harvesting from the bottom to allow the worms working in the top layers of the bin to remain undisturbed.

A cutting bar or “breaker” bar is pushed or pulled just above the mesh, releasing the bottom 1-2 inches of finished vermicompost through the mesh to the floor or conveyor below.

This cutting bar is powered electrically, hydraulically, or through the use of a manual winch for smaller systems.
