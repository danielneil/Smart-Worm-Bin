This doc is to help with R&D of our Smart Worm Farm, so this this should be your first point of reference for getting to know the technicalities. 

## Smart Worm Farm - Continuous Flow Design 

The Smart Worm Farm system will be a [continous flow system](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/), which might end up looking like the below:

With a little computer (nawwww) mounted somewhere external, and with probes inside to record metrics. 

#### Prototype Design: 
[Worm farm design considerations](https://github.com/danielneil/Smart-Worm-Farm/blob/main/research/bin-design.md).

## Little Computer (nawwww)

Initially, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB, will serve as a prototype, but R&D will occur with VirtualBox and [the Raspberry Pi Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/), so no need to purchase a Raspberry Pi just yet.

Depending on the results of battle testing the design, we'll know whether the Pi is up to the challenge.

## Sensors

### Infrared camera 

To watch them! :)

It needs to be infrared as worms are photosensitive.

### Soil Temp and Moisture Monitor

### Outside Temp

### Soil PH Monitor 
Hmmmmmmmmm - what to choose?
