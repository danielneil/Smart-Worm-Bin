This doc is to help with R&D of our little system, so this this should be your first point of reference for getting to know the technicalities. 

## Little Computer (nawwww)

Initially, the Raspberry Pi 4 Model B 4GB, will serve as a prototype, but R&D will occur with VirtualBox and [the Raspberry Pi Desktop](https://www.raspberrypi.org/software/raspberry-pi-desktop/), so no need to purchase a Raspberry Pi just yet.

Depending on the results of battle testing the design as to whether the Pi will serve as the final

## Worm Farm 

An ideal of the project is that the little Computer (nawwww) will be compatiable with any type of worm farm, but our system be a [continous flow system](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/), which might end up looking like the below:

To finance construction, I plan to crowdfund it.

## Infrared camera 

To watch them! :)

It needs to be infrared as worms are photosensitive.
