This doc is to help with R&D of our Smart Worm Habitat, so this this should be your first point of reference for getting to know the technicalities. 

## Smart Worm Habitat
The Smart Worm Habitat will be a [continous flow system](https://urbanwormcompany.com/complete-guide-to-continuous-flow-vermicomposting/).

With a little computer (nawwww) mounted externally, and with sensors located inside to record metrics.
