# Smart Worm Farm - Bin Design Considerations

The Smart Worm Farm is based on the premise of a continous flow vermicomposting system.

## What is Continuous Flow Vermicomposting?

Continuous flow vermicomposting is a method of vermicomposting where composting worms are fed organic matter from the top and worm castings are 
eventually harvested from the bottom. 

This top-to-bottom "flow" allows for harvesting vermicast from the bottom while worms working in the top layers of the bin remain undisturbed.

It looks like a rectangular prism without a bottom, and a soft/hard(?) top in order to give the worms some privacy ;).

## The Bin's Bottom (Or lack there of)

The bin is bottomless, and instead has a steel mesh/grate which stops the vermicast from falling out.

## The Bin's Breaker Bar

A cutting bar or “breaker” bar is pushed or pulled just above the mesh, releasing the bottom 1-2 inches of finished vermicompost through the mesh to the floor or conveyor below.

## The Breaker Bar's Winch

This breaker bar is pulled by an electrical or hydraulically powered winch, which drags the breaker bar with a long wire.

Ideally, the breaker bar can be "raised" or "lowered" several inches, to increase the size of the "cut". 

## Bin Measurements

Rectangle Prism Calculations ( Worm Bin )

Metrics for 1 unit of a modular system. 

Formula:
	Volume =  Length x Width x Height 

Constants:
	Height: 63.5cm (Height based on worm behavior) 
	Width: 150cm 
	Length: 200cm
	Therefore 

	Volume = 200cm x 150cm X 63.5cm

## Bin Measurements Rectangle Prism Calculations ( Breaker Bar )

Metrics for 1 unit of a scrape. 

Formula:
	Volume =  Length x Width x Height 
1350 
Constants:
	Height: 8cm (Height based on worm behavior) 
	Width: 150cm 
	Length: 200cm
	Therefore 

	Volume = 200cm x 150cm X 8cm
